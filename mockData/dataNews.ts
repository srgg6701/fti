But let's imagine that everything doesn't go according to plan, and bitcoin starts to decline, the expert says.\n\nAccording to him, the most urgent risk now is the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. If the Strait of Hormuz is blocked, this will lead to an increase in oil prices, followed by higher prices for other goods, and inflation will rise again, the analyst explains. He clarified that in such a situation, the US Federal Reserve System (FRS) will keep the rate high for longer, and this will hit the entire market, including bitcoin.\n\nHowever, now, judging by the growth at the beginning of the week, the market does not envisage such a scenario: based on the current dynamics, investors believe that even if the escalation continues, it will not have a serious impact on the economy, Krajko said.\n\nToday, the market is positive: it expects growth, lower rates, and a continuation of the rally, said Alexander Kraiko, a leading analyst at Cifra Markets.
