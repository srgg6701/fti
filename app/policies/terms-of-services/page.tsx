        or using the Service in any way, you agree to these Terms. If you do not
        agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User, You, Your</strong> — any person or entity using the
          Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trader / Provider</strong> — a user whose trades may be copied
          by others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follower</strong> — a user who copies trades of a Trader.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Broker</strong> — a third-party brokerage where users hold
          trading accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Copy Trading</strong> — the mechanism by which trades from a
          Trader are replicated in a Follower’s linked Broker account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Account</strong> — your user account on Platform and/or linked
          Broker account for copy trading.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be legally able to enter into binding contracts in your
        jurisdiction. You must not be a resident of any country or area where
        use of this Service is prohibited (e.g. due to sanctions). You represent
        that use of the Service does not violate local laws in your country.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Registration & Account Security</h2>
      <p>
        You must provide accurate, up-to-date information when registering. You
        are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
        credentials. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use
        of your account.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Linking Broker Accounts & Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        You authorize us to replicate trades into your linked Broker account, in
        accordance with the copy trading mechanism. You retain full control: you
        may stop copying, close positions, or unlink your Broker account at any
        time. The Platform does not guarantee execution at the same price or
        volume as the Trader due to latency, slippage, or Broker constraints.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Copy Trading Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        Trades are replicated pro rata relative to your capital vs. the Trader’s
        capital, unless specified otherwise. Differences may arise due to
        rounding, partial fills, slippage, market conditions, and Broker
        restrictions. Copying may be paused automatically (e.g. due to margin
        call, Broker rules, or failure to meet requirements).
      </p>

      <h2>6. Fees & Payments</h2>
      <p>
        We may charge subscription fees, performance fees, or other fees (as
        described on our pricing page). Fees shall be deducted from your account
        or via the payment method you provided. All fees are non-refundable
        unless otherwise specified in the Refund Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>7. User Conduct & Prohibited Activities</h2>
      <p>
        You must not use the Service for illegal or unethical trading practices
        (fraud, market manipulation, wash trading). You must not reverse
        engineer, tamper, or exploit vulnerabilities in our software. You must
        comply with all applicable laws including AML / KYC requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Risk Disclosure & Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        Copy trading is inherently risky. You may lose part or all of your
        capital. Past performance of any Trader is not indicative of future
        results. We are not financial advisors and do not guarantee profits or
        shield you from losses. We disclaim liability for indirect, incidental,
        or consequential damages, including losses from Broker failures,
        connectivity issues, or market events.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Suspension, Termination & Account Closure</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms or
        suspected abuse. You may terminate your account at any time. After
        termination, you may still owe outstanding fees. We may retain certain
        data for legal or compliance reasons.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All software, trademarks, content, and technology on the Platform are
        owned by us or our licensors. You receive a limited, non-exclusive
        license to use the Service in accordance with these Terms.

      <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Our total liability is limited to the amounts you have paid to us in the
        last 12 months. We are not liable for losses caused by third parties,
        Brokers, market volatility, connectivity issues, or other external
        events.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from any claims,
        losses, liabilities, or demands arising from your breach of these Terms
        or misuse of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Amendments</h2>
      <p>
        We may amend these Terms at any time by posting the revised version on
        our site. Your continued use constitutes acceptance of changes.

      <h2>14. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the United Arab Emirates.

        (with Refund Policy and Privacy Policy) govern your use.
